Forced transactions are an L1-backed fallback path for submitting Linea L2 transactions.

Instead of relying only on the public L2 mempool path, users can submit a signed L2 transaction to
L1 through the forced transaction system. This creates a processing guarantee that is enforced at
finalization.

## Understand what forced transactions are

Forced transactions let a user register an L2 transaction on L1 so it must be processed by a
deadline.

This is a liveness and anti-censorship mechanism. It gives users a path that does not depend only
on the regular sequencer mempool route.

:::warning Processing guarantee
Forced transactions guarantee processing by a deadline, not successful execution.

The sequencer must attempt to execute the transaction before the deadline, but the transaction can
still fail on L2 for reasons such as invalid nonce, insufficient balance, low gas limit, or contract
revert.

## Enable forced transactions in your app

Builders should support forced transactions when they want stronger delivery guarantees for
important flows.

Key reasons to enable support:

- reduce censorship and liveness risk for critical users and automated agents
- protect high-impact flows such as withdrawals, liquidations, emergency actions, and governance
- provide a transparent fallback path during congestion or degraded sequencer conditions
- improve user trust with a clear "processed by deadline" guarantee model

## Choose when to use forced submission

Most transactions should still use the normal path first, with forced transactions as a fallback.

| Transaction path | Best for | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Normal L2 submission | Everyday UX | No explicit processing deadline guarantee |
| Forced submission via L1 | Critical operations | Extra L1 fee and integration complexity |

## Follow the submission flow

1. Sign an EIP-1559 transaction for Linea L2.
2. Fetch the latest finalized state fields from `LineaRollup`.
3. Submit the signed transaction and required fee to `ForcedTransactionGateway` on L1.
4. Let the coordinator forward the forced transaction event to the sequencer.
5. Confirm that processing occurred before the deadline.

    participant Gateway as ForcedTransactionGateway (L1)

    participant Coordinator as Coordinator (offchain)
    participant Sequencer as Sequencer (L2)

    User->>Gateway: submitForcedTransaction(lastFinalizedState, signedTx) + fee
    Gateway->>Gateway: Validate fees, tx fields, signature, address filter, and finalized state
    Gateway->>Rollup: storeForcedTransaction(...)
    Rollup-->>Coordinator: ForcedTransactionAdded event
    Coordinator->>Sequencer: Forward signed transaction and deadline metadata
    Sequencer->>Sequencer: Attempt execution before deadline
    Note over Rollup,Sequencer: Missing passed-deadline tx makes finalization revert
```

## Build the finalized state payload

The gateway validates submissions against a `LastFinalizedState` struct.

Required fields:

- `timestamp`
- `messageNumber`
- `messageRollingHash`
- `forcedTransactionNumber`
- `forcedTransactionRollingHash`

Recommended retrieval flow:

1. Read the latest `FinalizedStateUpdated` event from `LineaRollup`.
2. Extract `timestamp`, `messageNumber`, and `forcedTransactionNumber`.
3. Query `rollingHashes(messageNumber)` for `messageRollingHash`.
4. Query `forcedTransactionRollingHashes(forcedTransactionNumber)` for the forced tx rolling hash.
5. Submit quickly so your state snapshot does not become stale.

```typescript
const events = await lineaRollup.queryFilter(lineaRollup.filters.FinalizedStateUpdated());
const latest = events[events.length - 1];

const { timestamp, messageNumber, forcedTransactionNumber } = latest.args;
const messageRollingHash = await lineaRollup.rollingHashes(messageNumber);
const forcedTransactionRollingHash = await lineaRollup.forcedTransactionRollingHashes(
  forcedTransactionNumber,
);

const lastFinalizedState = {
  timestamp,
  messageNumber,
  messageRollingHash,
  forcedTransactionNumber,
  forcedTransactionRollingHash,
};
```

## Understand deadline semantics

The system computes a `blockNumberDeadline` for each forced transaction.

This deadline is the latest acceptable L2 block by which the sequencer must process the transaction.
It is not a target block.

Operationally, this means:

- the sequencer can process the transaction at any earlier block
- processing after the deadline is too late
- finalization reverts when a passed-deadline forced transaction is missing

## Verify integrity and ordering

Forced transactions are chained using a MiMC-based rolling hash.

That rolling hash commits to an ordered sequence of forced transactions and is checked during
finalization proofs. This mechanism prevents:

- skipped forced transactions
- unauthorized inserted transactions
- reordering attacks

In practice, finalization enforces two guarantees:

- every forced transaction with a passed deadline has been processed
- the proven rolling hash matches the onchain rolling hash at the finalized forced tx number

## Reduce execution failure risk

A forced transaction can be processed and still fail to execute successfully.

Use this checklist before signing:

- refresh nonce just before signing
- estimate gas on Linea and add a safety buffer
- ensure enough L2 ETH for `value + gasLimit * maxFeePerGas`
- simulate calldata where possible
- submit promptly after reading finalized state
